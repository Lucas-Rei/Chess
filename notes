Move space
- is generated whenever a piece is clicked on
- group of move spaces
- idea: for loop inside of chess piece, whenever a space is clicked, use that space's position to move the piece
- better idea: use a 

Chess placement
- each chess piece has an x and y value that is relative to the number of squares on a chess board (8 x 8)
- use the value of 1 - 8 and convert to actual screen value (6 = 500) use constructor?

Chess movement/capture
- check value of premeditated move and determine if it is valid
- capture i guess just delete a piece if another one is there

Movement graphics
- show spaces that the piece can move to

Check and checkmate
- this is gonna be hard ngl

Castling
- hrmmmmmm
