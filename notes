0 initial background sample
0 chess piece samples
0 basic pygame
0 chess placement
0 move space
0 chess movement/capture 
0 all those other pieces' moves (don't forget pawn)
- check and checkmate
- illegal move prevention
- blocking check
- castling
- pawn promotion
- chess piece and board full pictures (do in pixel art)

Move space
- is generated whenever a piece is clicked on
- group of move spaces
- idea: for loop inside of chess piece, whenever a space is clicked, use that space's position to move the piece
- better idea: use a ALREADY DID IT

Chess placement
- each chess piece has an x and y value that is relative to the number of squares on a chess board (8 x 8)
- use the value of 1 - 8 and convert to actual screen value (6 = 500) use constructor?

Chess movement/capture
- check value of premeditated move and determine if it is valid
- capture i guess just delete a piece if another one is there


Check
- so maybe this
- use a new list for check_spaces, it will contain coords only
- make a new method for each piece except for king
- copy paste the moveset generator into this new method, it wont have args btw
- instead of generating movespaces generate coords
- use method in king update() to get the list of coords
- loop thorugh enemy pieces and use list to determine if it has view of the king
Illegal king moves & Checkmate
- use the enemy pieces' coord list to determine if the move is valid
- if there are no valid moves (AKA coord list is empty), and an enemy piece is in view of the king, end the game and the opposite color wins
- if there are no valid moves, check if any other ally pieces can move. If not, stalemate
Pins and other Illegal moves
- I GOT IT
- so generation is based on other pieces coords right
- so after you move a piece the coord is different and 
Blocking check
- bro this is so fucking hard i thought this would be eaassysfsaiodfiasfhhsa


Castling
- probably just flags lmao

Pawn promotion
- just check if its at the "end" (based on color) and make it a queen

Just notes:
- 60 x 60 for each piece
- black colors: 4d4d4d, 2e2e2e, 262626
- white colors: d4d4d4, b5b5b5, adadad
